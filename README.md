## Ivanâ€™s Comments
Using the example from Eric Pogue in class and with some help from ChatGPT and W3 Schools I was able to complete my assignment to meet all the requirements. 

This was my first time using Visual Studio and that was great practice editing the HTML and CSS code. 

I now have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
