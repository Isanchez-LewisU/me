			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p> Hello everyone! I am a 24 year old student at Lewis University pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science. 
                My father is an electrician and he works at one of the largest data centers in the Midwest. 
                He was a big influence in why I wanted to pursue a career in computer science. I have two 
                younger sisters and I&rsquo;m very happy to be the cool big bro. I&rsquo;m also very proud of my mom for trying
                to better her English to get a job again. I often remind my family that it&rsquo;s great
                to continue learning. Whether they&rsquo;re learning a new language, a new hobby, whatever it is, never stop learning. 
            </p>
